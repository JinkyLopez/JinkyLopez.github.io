                    <strong>Early Years</strong> <br> My sister is the second child in the family, born 4 years after
                    our eldest brother. I call her "Ate Ei" (Older Sister Ei in English). When Ate Ei entered elementary
                    school at our hometown, she was considered a genius. She is the validectorian on every year level
                    she went on, bringing pride and honor to the family, which continued until high school. She always
                    bagged the top ranking at school, the Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper, and the
                    representative of the school on most intellectual competitions.

                    <strong>College Life</strong> <br> As far as I can remember, she was graduating in high school and
                    went to straight to college when I gained consciousness. Thankfully, she doesn't have to rent alone
                    since she is with my dad, who
                    works as a taxi driver in the city. Our parents' savings are just enough to keep us by on our daily
                    needs so my sister had to apply to multiple scholarships. She is also a consistent Dean's Lister
                    (which awards them with tuition discounts), and also works summer jobs during vacation. She
                    graduated top 1 in the whole college of accountancy in the university (UC), achieving yet another
                    milestone.

                    <strong>The Provider</strong> <br> Being the one of the topnotchers during their bar examination, my sister didn't have any problems to land a job. She bought herself a laptop, which is very expensive and considered a luxury, at least for us, during that time. She would let us watch movies saved in it, and it was the happiest feeling when we all gather in our shared room to watch "The Forbidden Kingdom" or "Journey to the Center of the Earth". I'm not sure how much she gives to the family but I can say she is a great help to our parents because there are 7 of us in the family, the four still in school.

                    <strong>Ate Ei Goes Abroad</strong><br> In 2018, my sister decided to go abroad and work there. For four years, she sacrificed being away from the family just so she can provide for all of us. She has been the to-go helper of my family, including our close relatives. When the pandemic hit and we all got stuck in our hometown with no source of food and money, she's the one who sent us money every month to get by. I cannot express how thankful I am for my sister and her sacrifices. For me, she is a beacon of light, an undying fire of compassion and kindness for everyone around her.

                    <strong>The Homecoming</strong><br> Just last year, my sister finally went back home here in the Philippines. It is only I who's still studying so expenses have been way more manageable now, especially since I have a scholarship already. My sister finally got married with her long-time boyfriend, and lived on their own. Despite living on a separate house, she still insists to pay for some of our expenses. I will never forget what she said when one time, I decided to pay for the electric bill since I have some money from my scholarship. She immediately replied, "No, this is my responsibility. Keep your money dahil ako na ang bahala."

                To my sister, you always sacrifice for us and I can never thank you enough for that. I will always remember keep them in my heart. I will do my best to be as successful as you, and to be more, to be able to give back everything you have done for us.
